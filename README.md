- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vasquez777
- 👀 I’m interested in OOP, functional programming, app development, machine learning, mobile development, data visualization, web development, and all the boring, tedious stuff no one else wants to do.
- 🌱 I am primarily focused on Java at the moment but, I'm also learning Python, Kotlin, and JavaScript. I am studying "Designing Data Intensive Applications", and a plethora of random online information.
- 💞️ Currently looking to collaborate on any basic level projects and perhaps network with other newcomers to give eachother a leg up in the programming world. 
- "If you dont succeed the first time, call it version 1.0!"
- 📫 Call me!
